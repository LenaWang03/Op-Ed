              >What is “real” art, and who gets to decide? The artist? The
              original inventor of art as a whole? A group of old white men
              sitting in a conference room? The Guardian certainly had their
              opinions on this topic after writing an article entitled
              <i>Sorry MoMA, video games are not art</i> when MoMA declared that
              Nathalie Lawhead’s unconventional video game-esque interactive
              zine <i>Everything is Going to be OK</i> was going to be featured
              in its galleries. Lawhead knew the criticism she was going to
              receive when choosing this unconventional medium but did it anyway
              because she refused to reduce her art to fit with traditional art
              standards. Her refreshing oddity of an art piece proves that art
              is just a form of self-expression that should be void of rules by
              challenging traditional conceptions of what real art can be.

              >The work’s opening scene brings you to a directory screen
              displaying the 27 interactable zine pages that ignore all forms of
              design principles and techniques typically seen in fine art
              pieces. Visually, this page looks like a mistake -- something that
              is broken -- because it features a fever dream of clashing colours
              such as bright reds, greens, and cyans, glitching page buttons,
              unsettling sound effects, flashing posterized graphics, and
              indecipherable background imagery that one could describe as
              anxiety-inducing and eye-straining. Lawhead does this to emphasize
              that although this aesthetic found on the opening page and
              throughout the game does not follow traditional art conventions,
              it does not reduce its quality as art because real art should not
              have any rules.

              >While one could get lost in the never-ending labyrinth of unusual
              graphics, the unconventional dialogue featuring intimate thought
              pieces and poetry addressing highly stigmatized topics such as
              suicide, anxiety, and depression shows that she is using this
              piece as a means of self-expression. For example, an excerpt from
              the piece reads: “If life were a person, I would shun life and
              hate life and resent life for everything that it put me through.
              For everything that it did to me”. The uncensored and blunt nature
              of Lawhead’s borderline crass comments defies the poised and
              refined values associated with fine art. It proves that she is not
              afraid to express her emotions and thoughts to their full extent,
              which is the main goal that real art should have.</highlight

              >So if all of this is true, why is there so much controversy on
              classifying video games as art? According to the Guardian, “No one
              'owns' the game, so there is no artist, and therefore no work of
              art”, in other words, they believe that something has to be owned
              to qualify as real art. This is a flawed argument because as we’ve
              learned through the readings of this class, art should be timeless
              and speak universal truths on its own, so I believe that real art
              should be thought of as independent from its creator or owner,
              contrary to what the Guardian believes.</highlight

            <highlight
              >This dark-humoured piece embodies and accepts the broken and
              makes room for everyone in the fine art world by redefining what
              real art can be. Art shouldn’t be thought of as something that can
              be gate-keeped or owned by a particular group. It is a flexible
              and free-flowing form of self-expression that anyone can
              participate in. Thanks to Lawhead, everything broken, weird,
              rejected, or discarded can find its home here between the lines of
              HTML code and amalgamation of saturated colours and MS Paint-esque
              graphics. Artists should continue to follow in her footsteps to
              reclaim the fine art world to make it more inclusive and
              accessible to everyone. So, sorry Guardian, but video games are
              art.</highlight
